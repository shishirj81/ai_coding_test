# ai_coding_test

Hello,

All the image files are assumed to be in "images" directory. There is also a file **train.csv** which contains the file names with the lable 'apple'. 
To make the algorithm effectively we can add some images in the directory which are for non apples and the corresponding lables should be added to the training file.
**apple_classifier.ipynb** code file is shared in the repository which shows the ML program used to solve the problem.


Best Regards,
